## overview

Workflow to generate figure 1 (study site map(s)) for the *Persistent and lagged effects of wildfire on stream biogeochemistry due to intermittent precipitation in arid lands* manuscript.

The work of delineating catchments and extracting fire data was addressed in other workflows but those workflows are recreated as much as possible in `valles_caldera_fires.R` and `santa_barbara_fires.R`. Each of those workflows require MTBS data. Owing to the size of MTBS data, that resource is not included here.
